# AI and Blockchain for Social Media Authentication

This repository contains the literature review and supplementary materials for a project to enhance authentication mechanisms in social media applications through AI and blockchain technologies.

## Project Overview
The project investigates how AI-driven anomaly detection and blockchainâ€™s decentralized architecture can be combined to create robust and user-centric authentication systems for social media platforms. Key objectives include:
- Detecting and preventing identity theft using behavioral biometrics.
- Employing blockchain to ensure tamper-resistant and transparent authentication records.
- Enhancing user privacy and security in mobile social networks.
